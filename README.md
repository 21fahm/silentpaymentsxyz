# SilentPayments.xyz

This repo is the open source code for the website [SilentPayments.xyz](https://silentpayments.xyz).

## Contributing

If you see something that could be improved or simply want to add a new wallet to the wallet support page, you can test the change locally before PRing using the following guide:

1. [Install Hugo for your operating system](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethforprivacy/silentpaymentsxyz.git
```

3. Initialize the theme submodule

```bash
git submodule init
```

4. Make your changes as you see fit
5. Test your changes using Hugo (the output of this command will tell you where to connect to the dev site, usually http://localhost:1313/)

```bash
hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender
```

6. PR your changes!

If it's a simple text change you may not need to do any of this, and can just edit the file in Github, PR, and I can test locally as I have time.
