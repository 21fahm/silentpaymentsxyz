👋 Hello! Welcome to the SilentPayments.xyz documentation!

## What is SilentPayments.xyz?

I've put together this website to help rally the Bitcoin community around an invaluable privacy tool, Silent Payments. There has already been fantastic traction to integrate Silent Payments into several wallets, but I thought there was a gap in documentation and explanations that I could fill.

In this documentation I'll break down what Silent Payments are and why we need them, keep you up to date on what wallets support Silent Payments, and point wallet developers out there to the best libraries and resources on integrating Silent Payments into their wallet.

## Questions or Feedback?

  This website is a labor of love, done in my spare time.
