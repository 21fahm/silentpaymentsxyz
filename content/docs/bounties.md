### Some notes

Given the recent events, some people may have concerns about this bounty. We are very much aware of previous antagonisms and online flame wars especially on this issue, and this bounty is not a provocation either, we just want the idea of bitcoin privacy to keep spreading and think that this bounty makes our point, that what Samourai stands for is still as true and valuable as ever, that privacy is not something that should be frowned upon, but something that is not only legitimate but necessary, and a fight we can all agree to carry on regardless of personal antagonisms.
