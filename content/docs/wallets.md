One of the hardest things to keep up with in the Bitcoin space is keeping up with what wallets have deployed new features, what specific aspects have been deployed, and much more.

I'll do my best to keep this page up to date, but if you see something that needs to be updated please submit a PR (use that "Edit this page on Github" button ->) or [open an issue](https://github.com/sethforprivacy/silentpaymentsxyz/issues).
